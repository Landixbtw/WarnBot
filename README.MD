<h1> Silly little Warn Bot </h1>
This is a silly little Bot I stomped out in 2 days. 
It supports 2 Commands. 

- <code>/warn</code>: You need either a user ID, or you can select someone from the dropdown menu. If you want you can select a reason for the warn. Its not required tho
- <code>/info</code>: Either enter the ID or the username. It will give you all the Infractions a user has.

Right now you can only give 3 Warnings. Maybe I'll scale it but I dont think so.
